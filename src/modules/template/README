This is your entry point into OpenWalnut module development!

1. General:
***********

This directory contains a bunch of modules that demonstrate how to develop with/for
OpenWalnut. Get started with WToolkit. This file contains definitions for all the modules
that are required by OpenWalnut during load of your module.  Each module listed there can
than be found in the corresponding C++ files. They are extensively documented and describe
each step in detail. 

You need help? Check out our extensive code documentation when something is unclear, check
out http://www.openwalnut.org for more documentation or simply contact our developer
mailing list openwalnut-dev@lists.informatik.uni-leipzig.de.

Now, directly dive into the code. You will see, getting started with OpenWalnut module
development is easy!

2. Files and Topics:
********************

- WMTemplate.*
  -> this is where to start. In this example module, you will learn everything about
     developing modules. It shows how to work with data, parameters, and the general
     paradigms in OpenWalnut.

- WMTemplateContainers.*
  -> this module demonstrates the possibilities of combining modules into your own
     container modules. You will learn how to re-use other modules in your own complex
     networks/modules.

- WMTemplateUI.*
  -> this demonstartes the use of OpenWalnut's abstract view and widget API. You will
     learn how to write custom views the user can interact with. It also shows how to
     combine these views into other widgets and demonstrates the use of property widgets.

- WMTemplateShaders.*
  -> this module demonstrates OpenWalnut's powerful shader API. You will learn how to
     expand your OSG-based geometry with GLSL shaders and, even more importantly, how to
     interact with these shaders using your WProperties.

- WMTemplateColormaps.*
  -> this rather simple example demonstrates the colormapping API of OpenWalnut. You will
     learn how to color arbitrary geometry using the WGEColormapping mechanism.

- WMTemplateRenderPipelines.*
  -> this demonstrates the use of OpenWalnut's offscreen processing API. You will learn
     how to implement complex render pipelines and how to transfer data (textures) 
     between each steps.
