The main purpose of the <b>Transfer Function 1D</b> module is to provide an
interface that allows the user to edit one-dimensional transfer functions.</p>

<p>The most important and also most complex of its properties is the <b><i>Transfer
Function</i></b> property. The following image shows the property after the user has
already done some editing.</p>

The dark areas in the background are two different representation of the
histogram of the dataset. One is a linear and one is a logarithmic version of
the histogram. The histograms provide an overview of the data's value
distribution.</p>

<p>
The curve with the dots allows to manipulate the opacity assigned to different
data values. The upside down triangles in the upper part are used to assign
certain colors to the data values (colormap).
The colors between the triangles are obtained by linear interpolation. 
</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>
Both the curve and
the colormap can be adjusted by moving either the the dots or the triangles
with the left mouse button. New dots can be added by right-clicking into the
colormap. New triangles can be added by right-clicking in the area <i>above</i> the
colormap. Double-clicking with the left mouse button on one of the triangles
opens a color dialog and thus allows to change the color assigned to the
triangle. If the color dialog is open one can drag colors from the color dialog
to the different triangles.
